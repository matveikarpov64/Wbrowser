"""Decides whether the Chrome we are attached to is a 'logged-in window' or an 'empty dedicated window'.

Why this is needed: the fact that CDP responds only means the browser is alive,
not that it holds any login assets. We have actually driven an empty window
while reporting that we were ready.

The decision is made from the profile path — the cookie file size can't be read
because the original is locked, and page content requires opening a page, which is
slow. The userDataDir that CDP reports is the cheapest and surest discriminator.
